# Bad News Bears

Bad News Bears is an interactive and fun platform where users share their bad ideas and receive votes on them from other users.

The goal was to create a single page application using vanilla JavaScript for a frontend and a ruby on rails backend api.

In development, we used Chart.js to populate graphs based on votes. Also, we used custom CSS to design light animations with the angry bears.

# Concerns and Issues
- There is plenty of refactoring to be done in order to make cleaner and clearer code.
- Would love to make more user features.
